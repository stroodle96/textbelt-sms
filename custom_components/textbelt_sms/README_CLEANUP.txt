Removed the following files as part of the cleanup for a notification-only integration:
- coordinator.py
- data.py
- entity.py
- sensor.py
- switch.py
- binary_sensor.py

These files were part of the original integration_blueprint template and are not needed for a simple Textbelt SMS notification integration.
